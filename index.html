    <div class="about-me">
        <p>
        Hi! I'm a second-year Computer Science undergrad with a genuine passion for exploring the endless possibilities that tech has to offer. 
        I'm constantly curious and love diving into new tools, trends, and ideas. 
        Lately, I've been especially drawn to <strong>web development</strong>, <strong>UI/UX design</strong>, and <strong>data analytics</strong> — areas where I get to combine creativity with logic to solve real-world problems.
        </p>
        <p>
        Whether it’s building sleek interfaces, analyzing patterns in data, or experimenting with code just to see what’s possible, 
        I find joy in learning and growing through hands-on projects. 
        I'm always up for a challenge, eager to collaborate, and excited to keep pushing my skills forward.
        </p>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>Belimo - Internship</h3>
      <p>May 2025 : 1-week</p>
      <p>Completed a one-week internship at Belimo, where I gained valuable exposure to IT integration within HVAC systems. I explored how smart energy valves operate and how their data feeds into intelligent Building Management Systems (BMS). The internship provided hands-on insight into the Niagara platform and BACnet MSTP protocol. I also analyzed data flow in building automation and observed the application of IT in areas like logistics, finance, and technical support across a corporate environment.</p>
